Requirements for the Final Project
 

Logistics
Your project must be submitted as an importable Unity Package, and as a stand-alone player. Upload both to your team's Google Drive.

DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR ENTIRE UNITY PROJECT DIRECTORY.

UPLOAD ONLY YOUR STAND-ALONE PLAYER AND UNITY PACKAGE.

You must submit your project no later than 11:59 pm, Sunday, May 7.
This is so I can review your code before you present your project. Later versions will not be accepted for review.

In addition to your unitypackage and your player, submit a copy of your written report via ELMS. Each group member should submit a copies of the same report as every other member of your group, but each of you must submit something so ELMS can mark it as completed.


Requirements and Limitations:

Your project must be implemented in three dimensions, not just two. Orthographic/parallel projections are permitted, however. If you are not certain that your design meets this requirement, find a video of a game that uses the design you have in mind, send me the link, and I'll let you know if you can use it.

Do NOT use any models, animations, or code from the Asset Store, Mixamo, or any other source of pre-made models, animations, or code. Create all models, animations, and code yourselves. All requirements for this project can be met with the built-in shapes Unity provides. You may create your own models with a modeling tool such as SketchUp, Maya, or Blender (note that a free version of SketchUp is available via the Web; UMD students can obtain a free version of Maya via Terpware; Blender is free and open-source). You can also make models out of Unity's built-in shapes (and/or models you create) by assembling them into parent-child hierarchies.

As exceptions to the above, you may use these free models:

All of the above are from Kenney Game Assets and are free to download and use. Note: I am not affiliated with Kenney Game Assets, but I will be able to recognize their models, which allows me to see easily which parts of your project you did yourself and which parts you downloaded. Be sure to limit yourself to the assets listed above, as not all assets at the Kenney site are on the list.

You are permitted to use any images as textures from any source you can legally access.

You are permitted to use any sounds from any source you can legally access.


Report:

When you submit your code, include a written report describing the elements that you believe satisfy some part of the grading criteria below. Keep your report below 1,000 words, with one report per team. In your report, identify any assets you did not create yourself.


Grading
As you consider how you will approach the various elements laid out below, be sure to include comments in your code that call out the features you believe are worthy of adding points to your score, and why.

I should emphasize that I don't expect that every project will score high on all areas.

Because every project is unique, it is difficult to define a formal standard for grading the projects. I have attempted to set up a system that is fair to everyone. I aimed to determine the degree of effort involved in the various game elements, with the understanding that the objective is to produce an interesting game that demonstrates your ability to use the material taught in this course. This included technical elements (e.g., AI, animation, physics, game semantics), visually creative elements (models, shading, graphics), sound (effects, music), psychological components (flow channel, simulation/stimulation, emotional content), and engineering (algorithms, level of difficulty, user interface).


Positives:

Below are a set of criteria that I will consider in assigning scores. Because each project is a mixture of qualities, it is understood that each project will score higher on some criteria and lower on others, so no project is likely to receive a perfect score.

Concept: 15% Does the game present some new experience to the human player? Are the game mechanics comprehensible? Does the game exploit the tropes of its game-style and narrative genres?

Visual and Artistic Elements: 15% Is the game visually appealing in terms of the balance of artistic elements (color, composition, etc)? Do the models make sense in the overall setting? Do the artistic elements complement each other, as opposed to being a hodge-podge of mismatched choices? Do the sound elements (effects and background) enhance the experience? Does the game incorporate complex visuals (object animation, visual effects, movement in lighting and shading, significant use of parent/child object relations)? Do these effects complement the game's overall structure?

Algorithmic Complexity: 20% 
Does the implementation require the design/implementation of nontrivial algorithms (e.g., for AI, navigation, physics, puzzles, procedural model creation, game mechanics, user interface), as opposed to standard resources provided by the game engine?

Gameplay: 15%
Does the game create a flow channel experience for the player? Is interaction between the game and the player sensible, rather than confusing? Is there a win condition? 

Completeness: 15% 
Does the game provide introductory and ending scenes, tutorials and instructions, multiple levels? Are their in-game mechanisms to inform the player of their progress? Does the game provide a number of distinct elements with which the player can interact? Are the user controls easy to work with?

Intangibles: 10% 
Are there any other features of the game that do not fit in the above categories?

Presentation and Report: 10% 
Did the presentation and report do a good job of explaining the game's features?

We will try to arrange for each group to have five members. If your group has only four members, a slightly more lenient standard will apply to your project. If your group has five members, you will need to score well on most of the criteria above to do well overall.


Negatives:

It is possible to score negatives as well as positives. Obvious flaws that conflict with the positive components list above can prevent a project from reaching the maximum score in a given criterion.

Concept: Does the game merely mimic existing games without adding anything new? Does the game appear to be within a genre without meeting reasonable expectations?

Visual and Artistic Elements: Do the models, colors, or textures create mismatches in size, spacing, or contrast? Is sound missing in places where it should be heard, or present where it shouldn't be heard? Do the models interact with each other and the environment improperly, such as penetrating each other when they shouldn't or becoming hard to see?

Algorithmic Complexity: Does the code make use of Unity features, or does it show a lack of awareness of their existence or how they operate? Is it needlessly complex at any point? Is it too simple for the function it has to perform?

Gameplay: Are the controls too sensitive or too sluggish? Does the game grow boring or frustrating unevenly? Are there confusion interactions that the player would be unlikely to understand?

Completeness: Does the game show too much effort in one area, such as level design, with too little in another, such as instructions, when a better distribution of time and labor would have balanced it better? Is it lacking in some feedback the player needs?

Intangibles: Does the project rely excessively on techniques or resources we did not cover?

Presentation and Report: Is the report disorganized or ungrammatical? Did the presentation omit some important aspects of how the game meets the positive criteria?
